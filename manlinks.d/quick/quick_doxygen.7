.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
Let's just use examples to illustrate usage:
.SS Function Documentation
.PP
.EX
/**
 * @brief Short description of function
 *
 * Unmarked text in a Doxygen comment block will be used for the
 * detailed function description.
 *
 * The detailed description can span several lines or paragraphs.
 *
 * @param Arg1   Integer argument for the function
 * @param Arg2   String argument for the function
 * @param Arg3   Struct argument for the function.  The argument
 *               description can span multiple lines.
 *
 * @return The exit value is 0 for success, or an error code
 *         for failure.  Refer to errno(1) for values.

.SS Enum Documentation
.PP
An enumeration may document the set of allowed values for an
integer parameter or return value.
There is a Doxygen syntax for documenting enums.
.PP
.EX
/** This enum class is da bomb! */
enum int dabomb {
   cap,          ///< smallest explosive
   bang_snap,    ///< once a particular favorite of kids in grade school
   firecracker,  ///< can seriously injure someone if used carelessly
   cherry_bomb,  ///< once more dangerous than a firecracker
   dynamite,     ///< criminals and miners love it
   hand_grenade, ///< used in war
   land_mine,    ///< buried explosive
   missle,       ///< self-propelled lethal explosive
   bomb,         ///< big booms
   nuke          ///< the biggest boom
};
