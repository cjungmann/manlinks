.SH NAME
.B groff debugging
\- Tips and tricks for advanced groff programming
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This document aspires to provide some basic debugging tools to
aid authors when they step beyond
.I man page
writing macros.
.PP
The
.I groff language
is overwhelming.
.I Groff
output is typically generated from files that depend on
extensive macros to simplify authoring.
However, using the underlying
.I groff language
can significantly improve your documents.
.PP
This document starts modestly, but should grow as my experience expands.
.SH TERMINAL MESSAGE
.PP
This simple request sends the text arguments to
.IR stderr .
.PP
.RS
\&.te Send this text to stderr.
.RE
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
.I Groff
incorporates the idea of an
.BE environment .
The environment consists of all the current settings with which
the
.B groff
processor is working.
It includes fonts, indentation, line lengths, spacing, and more.
.PP
The
.B .pev
request prints, to
.IR stderr ,
the contents of the stack of environments, starting with the current
environment.
.PP
To view the output, you should use
.BR groffer " because" man
does not respect the
.B .pev
request.
.PP
Although you might see part of the printed environment with a normal
document display, you will rarely see all of it.
To see all of the output, redirect
.B stdout
to a file:
.PP
.RS
$ groffer --tty my_man_page.7 2>env_notes.txt
