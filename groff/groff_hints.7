.SS Editing Hints
.PP
I write code primarily the
.B Emacs
editor.
.B Emacs is well-suited for creating
.B man
and other roff pages.  Here are some things that have helped me.
.\" ============
.TP
.BR "Use Emacs major-mode nroff" :
.br
.B Emacs
may not recognize your document as a roff document, resulting in
your editing being done in
.I Fundamental
mode.  Explicitely call for
.B man
page editing mode with:
.EX
.BI "M-x " nroff-mode
.EE

.\" ============
.TP
.B View nroff-mode help
.br
This advice applies to any
.Emacs
major mode, once you're in the appropriate mode, learn or review
the mode's features by looking at its help page:
.EX
.B C-h m
.EE
.\" ============
.TP
.B Activate \*(lqnroff\*(rq mode
.br
Get a previous of how your man page will be formatted by opening a
.BR nroff-view .
