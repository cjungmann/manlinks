.SS Using Modes
.PP
\*(Nm provides a bounty of editing
.B modes
that empower users to do their best work.  Most of the time,
\*(Nm enables the appropriate mode according to the file being
edited, and the user doesn't have to think much about it.
.PP
However, sometimes \*(Nm can't identify the file type, and other
times the \*(Nm mode omits something a user would like.  In these
times, a more thorough understanding of \*(Nm modes can be very
helpful
