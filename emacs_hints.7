.SS Using Modes
.PP
\*(Nm provides a bounty of editing
.B modes
that empower users to do their best work.  Most of the time,
\*(Nm enables the appropriate mode according to the file being
edited, and the user doesn't have to think much about it.
.PP
However, sometimes \*(Nm can't identify the file type, and other
times the \*(Nm mode omits something a user would like.  In these
times, a more thorough understanding of \*(Nm modes can be very
helpful
.TP
.B Show details about the current mode
.br
This is probably the most useful command for discovering features
about a given mode.

.SS Installing New Modes
.PP
.B Emacs
has a package manager that makes it easy to customize your
browser.
New editing modes are available in some of these packages.
Use the following short list of commands to learn how to
find and install packages.
.TP
.B m-x list-packages
.RS 7

for installation.

.PP
.RB \(lq i \(rq
for each package you want to select (a little
.RI \(lq i \(rq
will appear next to selected packages),
.PP
.RB \(lq u \(rq

.TP
.B Adding a Package Source
There may be times when you know a package exists, but it cannot
be found in your package manager.
You may be able to add another packages source to your package
manager.
For example, I wanted to use
.BR php-mode ,
but it wasn't available in the default packages.
I needed to add the
.B MELPA
packages.
.RS 7
.PP
Add the following lines to your
.I ~/.emacs.d/init.el
file:
.RS 4
.PP
.EX
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
    '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/"))
(add-to-list 'package-archives
    '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/"))
